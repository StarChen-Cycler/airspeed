# Data Collection Service — Core

YAML-driven, hardware-agnostic multi-stream data recorder. Subscribes to ROS2 topics,
validates messages against per-stream contracts, and writes AIRS-standard HDF5 episode files.

## Launch

```bash
cd data_collection_service
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
bash run_global_config.sh
```

`global_config.yaml` points to the active session YAML, output directory, and UI port.
Edit it to switch sessions or change the dashboard port.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy h5py pyyaml
```

ROS2 Humble required for live recording (mock session mode works without it).

## Quick Start

```bash
cd data_collection_service
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Start the collector
bash run_global_config.sh
```

This reads `global_config.yaml` for the session YAML, output directory, and UI port.
Recording dashboard at `http://localhost:8765`.

With mock publishers (no hardware needed):

```bash
# Terminal 1 — mock data
PYTHONPATH="core:tools" python3 tools/dev_mock_ros2_publishers.py \
  --config config/session_vr_ik_robot_button_control.yaml

# Terminal 2 — collector
bash run_global_config.sh
```

Pure Python mode (no ROS2, generates synthetic HDF5):

```bash
PYTHONPATH="core:tools" python3 tools/dev_mock_session.py \
  --config config/session_vr_ik_robot_button_control.yaml --record
```

Validate output:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="core:tools" python3 tools/validate_dataset.py data/episodes/<episode>.h5
```
```

Run tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="core:tests:tools" python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Architecture

```
Session YAML → SessionConfig → AdapterRegistry.resolve() → ROS2 subscriptions
                                                              |
ROS2 messages → adapter.adapt() → boundary validate → WriterSample
                                                              |
                                        recording gate (is_recording?)
                                                              |
                                        chunked batch buffer → HDF5 flush
```

Seven independently testable modules. Most unit tests run without ROS2.

### config/ — Session YAML Loader

**What it does**: Reads a YAML file from disk and turns it into a frozen Python object
that the rest of the system can rely on without re-validating.

**Why it exists**: Before this module, stream definitions were scattered across Python
files as string literals (`"joint_angles"`, `"/robot_joint_angles"`). Changing a topic
name meant editing code. Now the YAML file is the sole source of truth — change the YAML,
restart the collector, done. No code edit needed.

**Key file**: `session_config.py` (688 lines) — parses every field of the session YAML,
validates QoS enums, checks that `image_encoding` is only set on image streams, rejects
duplicate mapping keys, and produces an immutable `SessionConfig` with `StreamConfig`
entries. If parsing fails, the error message tells you exactly which field is wrong.

### contracts/ — Shared Data Models

**What it does**: Defines the data structures that every other module agrees on. Like a
dictionary that all modules share, so they don't need to know about each other.

**Why it exists**: When the adapter produces a `WriterSample` and the node shell passes
it to the writer, neither side needs to know what the other does internally. They only
need to agree on the shape of `WriterSample`. These shared types are the glue between modules.

**Key types**:
- `WriterSample` — a flattened data point ready for storage. Has exactly three fields: `stream_name`, `timestamp_ns`, and either `values` (tuple of floats) or `image_data` (bytes). The node shell checks which one is set and calls the matching writer method.
- `SourceFamily` — enum of `teleop`, `robot`, `sensor`. Determines which adapter binding to use.
- `StreamStatus` — enum of `healthy`, `degraded`, `stale`, `absent`, `invalid`. Used by the dashboard to show per-stream health.
- `RecordingState` — enum of `IDLE`, `RECORDING`, `SAVING`, `ABORTING`. The state machine's possible states.

### adapters/ — Message Extraction & Flattening

**What it does**: Takes a raw ROS2 message (a `PoseStamped`, a `JointState`, an `Image`,
etc.) and extracts the values declared in the YAML `fields` contract into a flat list of
numbers or bytes that the writer can store.

**Why it exists**: This is the key innovation. In the old system, extracting data from
each message type required handwritten callback code with hardcoded field names:

```python
# Old way — new message type = new callback
def _joint_angles_callback(self, msg):
    data = list(msg.data)  # hardcoded field path — breaks for any other message type
```

The new adapter is generic — it reads the YAML `fields` list and walks the message
structure to find each declared path. Adding a new stream type with an existing message
type requires zero code. Adding a new message type requires only a small payload builder
function; the flattening code is untouched.

**Key files**:
- `registry.py` — maps `(source, message_type)` pairs to adapter bindings. Each binding knows which payload builder to call and which profile to validate against. The `resolve_session()` method wires up the entire session in one call.
- `common.py` — the generic flattener `_writer_sample_from_payload()`. Recursively walks a validated dict, collects all numeric leaf values in sorted key order, and produces a `WriterSample`. The decision of vector vs. image is made by checking whether the `"data"` key holds bytes — no per-type `if/elif` dispatch.

### schema/ — Payload Profiles & Validation

**What it does**: Defines what a valid message looks like for each payload shape, and
checks every incoming message against those rules before it reaches the writer.

**Why it exists**: ROS2 delivers messages that match the declared type, but it doesn't
check that the *values* are sensible. A `PoseStamped` could have NaN positions or a
quaternion with zero norm. The boundary validator catches these before they land in the
HDF5 file, producing structured errors with the exact field path and reason.

**Key files**:
- `adapter_profiles.py` — defines `AdapterPayloadProfile` entries for each payload shape (teleop_pose, robot_joint_positions, sensor_rgb_image, etc.). Each profile lists which fields must exist, whether they are numeric or binary, and whether they are required.
- `boundary_validator.py` — checks every field in the `AdapterBoundarySample` against its profile: field presence, type match, numeric finiteness (no NaN/Inf), sequence length. Returns a validated sample or raises `AdapterBoundaryValidationError` with a structured error.

### runtime/ — Node Shell & Control

**What it does**: The operational layer. Creates ROS2 subscriptions, runs the ingest loop,
manages recording state, serves the browser dashboard, and tracks per-stream health.

**Why it exists**: Each concern is a separate class, so they can be tested independently
and composed in the node shell. The node shell itself is thin (~264 lines) — it wires
modules together but owns no logic.

**Key files**:
- `ros2_collection_node.py` — the main entry point. Creates subscriptions from the session config, routes incoming messages through the adapter pipeline, and passes `WriterSample` results to the writer. All message-type knowledge lives in the adapter; the node shell just calls `adapter.adapt()` and checks `sample.image_data is not None`.
- `recording_state.py` — a simple state machine with three states: IDLE, RECORDING, FAILED. All three control modes (service, UI, device binding) call the same `start_episode()` / `end_episode()` / `abort_episode()` methods. The state machine owns the truth; everything else reads it.
- `recording_control.py` — routes control commands from three possible sources (ROS2 services, browser buttons, teleop device messages) to the state machine. Implements toggle (one button starts AND stops) and delete (discard episode to `.trash/`) logic with a PENDING state between stop and the next action. Rising-edge debounce on button inputs plus a configurable `toggle_debounce_s` time window prevent accidental double-triggers. Each source is gated by `control_mode` in the session YAML.
- `manual_operator_ui.py` — a stateless HTTP server that pushes recording state, per-stream health, and task progress to the browser every 200ms via Server-Sent Events. Full task management: create named task folders with target episode counts, select existing tasks from a dropdown, real-time `#current/#total` display. Toggle and delete buttons follow the same logic as device binding mode. A breathing red dot indicates active recording.
- `stream_tracker.py` — counts messages received per stream, tracks valid/invalid ratios, computes observed rate, and classifies each stream as healthy/degraded/stale/absent/invalid. Reset per episode.

### storage/ — AIRS HDF5 Writer

**What it does**: Writes data to HDF5 files in the AIRS standard format, keeping memory
usage constant regardless of how long the episode runs.

**Why it exists**: A naive writer that accumulates all data in memory before writing would
crash on long episodes. This writer uses chunked batches — every 50 vector frames or 20
image frames, it resizes the HDF5 dataset and writes the batch contiguously, then clears
the in-memory buffer. Memory usage stays flat whether the episode is 10 seconds or 10 hours.

**Key file**: `airs_hdf5_writer.py` — creates HDF5 groups and datasets eagerly at episode
open (so the file structure is visible even during recording), appends data in small batches
via incremental `resize()` + write, and finalizes attributes (frame count, sample rate,
column names, encoding) at episode close.

### validation/ — Output Validator

**What it does**: After recording finishes, opens the HDF5 file and checks that it conforms
to the AIRS standard — correct structure, correct dtypes, matching dimensions between data
and timestamps, valid JPEG magic bytes for image streams.

**Why it exists**: Bugs in the recording pipeline (dropped messages, adapter errors, writer
crashes) can produce subtly malformed files that downstream training code chokes on. The
validator catches these before the file leaves the collection machine.

**Key file**: `dataset_validator.py` — checks root attributes, iterates every group,
verifies `type` attr is `vector` or `image`, checks data/timestamp shape consistency,
validates JPEG magic bytes for JPEG-encoded image streams. Returns a structured report
with errors and warnings.

## Session YAML Format

The session YAML is the sole source of truth. Every stream is a 1:1 contract with one ROS2 topic.

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"

session:
  name: "my_session"
  task_id: "my_task"
  operator_id: "my_operator"
  devices:
    vr_headset:
      device_id: vr-main
      role: teleop
  recording_control:
    mode: manual_ui            # service | manual_ui | device_binding
    toggle_debounce_s: 0.5
    bindings:                  # only used when mode=device_binding
      toggle:
        stream_name: vr_left_buttons
        button_index: 5
        threshold: 0.5
      delete:
        stream_name: vr_left_buttons
        button_index: 4
        threshold: 0.5
  notes: "optional session notes"

storage:
  root: "data/episodes"
  format: hdf5
  compression: gzip
  config_hash_algorithm: sha256

streams:
  arm_joints:
    source: robot
    topic: "/arm/joint_states"
    message_type: "sensor_msgs/JointState"
    time_domain: ros_header
    qos:
      reliability: best_effort
      durability: volatile
      history: keep_last
      depth: 1
    fields:
      - path: "position"
        type: sequence
        required: true
```

### Supported Message Types

| Message Type | Output |
|-------------|--------|
| `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped` | Vector: position(xyz) + orientation(xyzw) = 7 dims |
| `sensor_msgs/JointState` | Vector: position + velocity + effort |
| `sensor_msgs/Joy` | Vector: axes(N) — discrete/button streams with `header.stamp` |
| `sensor_msgs/Image` | Image: raw bytes or JPEG |
| `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` | Vector: flattened points |
| `sensor_msgs/Imu` | Vector: orientation(4) + angular_vel(3) + linear_accel(3) |

Adding a new message type requires only a payload builder function and a profile entry —
no changes to the flattening pipeline. See [device & stream onboarding guide](../../docs/device-onboarding-schema-guide.md).

## Recording Control

Three modes, all driving a single state machine with a **toggle + delete** model:

```
IDLE ──[toggle]──→ RECORDING
RECORDING ──[toggle]──→ PENDING  (episode saved, awaiting decision)
PENDING ──[toggle]──→ RECORDING  (episode kept, new episode starts)
PENDING ──[delete]──→ IDLE       (episode moved to .trash/)
```

**Toggle**: one button starts AND stops recording. **Delete**: discard the last episode
after stopping — only active in PENDING state. Episodes not explicitly deleted are kept.

### Modes

```bash
# Manual UI (browser dashboard at http://localhost:8765)
# Task management: create named task folders, select from dropdown,
#   real-time #current/#total episode count, recording breathing dot.
--operator-ui-port 8765

# ROS2 Service (tools/ scripts)
ros2 service call /platform_collection/start_episode std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
ros2 service call /platform_collection/end_episode std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"
ros2 service call /platform_collection/delete_episode std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
ros2 service call /platform_collection/abort_episode std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}

# Device Binding (toggle/delete bound to teleop buttons)
# Configure in session YAML: control_mode: device_binding
```

### Session YAML binding example

```yaml
recording_control:
  mode: device_binding
  toggle_debounce_s: 0.5
  bindings:
    toggle:
      stream_name: vr_left_buttons
      button_index: 5
      threshold: 0.5
    delete:
      stream_name: vr_left_buttons
      button_index: 4
      threshold: 0.5
```

`toggle_debounce_s` prevents a long button press from triggering stop→start in one hold.
`delete` binding is optional — omit it to disable per-episode discard.

## HDF5 Output (AIRS Standard)

Episodes are organized by task folder. File names include a `-T#` episode counter
based on the number of existing `.h5` files in that task folder (excluding `.trash/`):

```
data/episodes/
├── pick-apple/
│   ├── task_meta.json            {"task_name":"pick-apple","target_episodes":10,...}
│   ├── episode-T1-20260617T120000000000Z.h5
│   ├── episode-T2-20260617T120100000000Z.h5
│   ├── .trash/
│   │   └── episode-T3-20260617T120200000000Z.h5
│   └── ...
├── pour-water/
│   ├── task_meta.json
│   ├── episode-T1-20260617T130000000000Z.h5
│   └── ...
└── (episodes without a task go directly here)
```

### File structure

```
episode-T4-20260617T120000000000Z.h5
├── .attrs {description, robot_type, series_number, sample_rate, frames,
│           success, termination_reason}
├── /arm_joints/
│   ├── .attrs: {type: "vector", frames: 566, columns: '["dim_0",...]'}
│   ├── data        (566, D) float32
│   └── timestamps  (566,)  uint64
└── /camera_color/
    ├── .attrs: {type: "image", frames: 566, encoding: "jpeg"}
    ├── data        (566,)  vlen uint8
    └── timestamps  (566,)  uint64
```

Task folders contain a `task_meta.json` with `task_name`, `target_episodes`, and
`created_at`. The `.trash/` subfolder holds episodes discarded via the delete action.

Streams that produce no samples during an episode are omitted from the file at
close — a zero-frame stream leaves no HDF5 group behind (zero-length datasets
fail dataset validation and cannot be displayed by HDF viewers). Stream absence
is a runtime condition, visible in the dashboard's stream health panel, not in
the episode file.
